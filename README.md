# FetchMates-MSSA-Project
This is my project for MSSA, FetchMates, a dog park scheduling app

##Concept
I am a dog father of two dogs, dog lover, and a dog park enthusiast. I love going to the dog park but hate going to an empty dog park. This app would allow you to schedule dog park times and give you an idea of how many other dogs will be at the park near you (San Diego Focused). Also, it will allow you to create a profile for your dog and connect with other dogs that have a similar personality to your dog. The goal is to connect with other dog owners and be an informed dog park goer.
