# FetchMates-MSSA-Project
This is my project for MSSA, FetchMates, a dog park scheduling app

## Concept
I am a dog father of two dogs, dog lover, and a dog park enthusiast. I love going to the dog park but hate going to an empty dog park. This app would allow you to schedule dog park times and give you an idea of how many other dogs will be at the park near you (San Diego Focused). Also, it will allow you to create a profile for your dog and connect with other dogs that have a similar personality to your dog. The goal is to connect with other dog owners and be an informed dog park goer.

## System Requirements

### User Stories

As a new dog owner, I want to be able to find safe parks in my area so that I can bring my new dog to a dog park and know that he or she will be safe.

As a dog parent who just moved to San Diego, I would like to be able to locate multiple parks in my region and see the ratings of those parks so that I am aware of what I will experience when I am at that dog park.

As a new dog owner and a person who just moved to San Diego, I would like to be able to find other dogs and dog owners in my region so that I can start to socialize my dog and meet other dog owners.

As a San Diegan dog owner, I would like to be able to communicate with other dog owners on an app so that I can socialize my dog in an outdoor setting and be able to socially distance.

### Use Cases

Given the amount of dog parks in San Diego, when there are plenty of new dog owners, then I will provide Google map pinning all the known dog parks on Google Maps.

Given the amount of dog parks in San Diego, when some of these parks can get very packed, then I will create a calendar like feature which will let users schedule times that they will be at the dog park so that other owners can get an idea of peak and off-peak times.

Given a new dog owner when there are plenty of apps for people to meet, then I will create a matching feature strictly for dogs based on matching dogs based on their personalities so that no data is collected on the user rather just a small amount of information on the dog.

Given the current state of affairs with COVID when California is still enforcing regulations, then my app is going to be focused on meeting at dog parks that are outdoors and allows people to socially distance and let their dogs play. 


Given that not all dogs are friendly when there are dogs who do not enjoy dogs but still want to go to parks then the user will be able to use the calendar feature to get a picture of when the off-peak times are so that they can still bring their dog to the park to release their energy.
